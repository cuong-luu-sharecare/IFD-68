This is a first version of the KeyWalker IFD-68 firmware burner for Linux OS which I reversed from the original firmware.

The original firmware and documentation is in original/
Some reverse stuff is in reverse/
The actual firmare burner is in the burner/

Caution: when one want to burn a new firmware he need to do it from the other keyboard or reboot (unplug and plug cable) the keyboard after burning. Currently I don't know how to fix it. But I working on it.

Any help would be greate!
